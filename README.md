🚀 About Me

I am an IT Engineer with 1.6+ years of hands-on experience in database management, system operations, and infrastructure support.
Over time, I developed a strong interest in data analysis, SQL, and machine learning, and I am actively building projects in EDA, data cleaning, and feature engineering.

I enjoy solving real-world problems using:

SQL for analysis & data cleaning

Python for automation & ML

Structured thinking & clean logic

My goal is to transition into a Data Analyst / Data Scientist / ML Engineer role.
